Invoice and budget tracking
## Overview
We are developing a web application that allows users to make equipment requests and create invoices. It will also allow managers to see this requests and approve them individually. It will also keep a track of a department budget in a spreadsheet.

## Problem Statement
Many businesses need to be able to keep track of department spending. When employees request equipment, a lot of times this is approved without anyway of keep track of how much was spent. Therefore, we will create a application that allows users to request equipment and allows management to approve purchases while keeping track of their department's total spending.

## Target Users
This is mainly targeted for office use but can be configured to work with any kind of invoice tracking objective for accounting reasons.

## Expected Outcomes
This project will provide users with:
* An interface for users to create requests from a predefined list of items
* An interface for managers to approve these requests individually from a pool of invoices
* An interface for managers to be able to track spending related to the approved invoices

## Webpages Summary
We will have a total of 6 Pages

* Page 1: This page will be a login page where an approver or a client logs in.
* Page 2: If a client logs in then they will go to this page where they will choose if they want to make a new invoice or view their pending request. It's essentially a homepage for a client.
* Page 3: This page is where the client can make a new invoice. The page will include check boxes for office supply items that the user can check or not check. The user will then hit submit once they have selected the items they would like to purchase.
* Page 4: If an approver logs in then they will go to this page where they can view pending request and departments budgets. It's essentially a homepage for an approver.
* Page 5: This page is where an approver and client can view pending invoice request. The reviewer will be able to approve or deny the request by clicking a checkbox. There will also be a comment section for the approver to add any comments if they desire to let the client get more information about their request.
* Page 6: This page is where an approver can view departments overall budgets and see the departments previously approved request. The page will essentially show each department and show the totals for each of their approved invoices and then an overall total of all the combined invoices for that department.
 
## Summary
Overall, the end product will allow managers keep better track of their department spending and give users a quicker response time when making requests. Although we do already foresee some challenges in this (creating databases, managing security, etc) we are confident we can deliver this product by the end of this semester.
